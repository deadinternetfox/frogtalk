## ✨ Why FrogTalk?

> **Your chat, your server, your keys.** No company in the middle, no plaintext on disk, no telemetry tax.

- 🔐 **Real E2E** — Signal Protocol (X3DH + Double Ratchet) for DMs, per-room AES-256-GCM (AAD-bound, with key rotation on ban/kick) for private channels. The server stores ciphertext and nothing else.
- 🌐 **Federated** — your node talks to other nodes; users, profiles, posts, rooms and DMs replicate across the swamp.
- 🧅 **Tor-native** — flip a flag and your node lives behind a `.onion`; clearnet IP never leaks.
- 📱 **Everywhere** — Web, Android (APK), iOS (TestFlight), Windows portable, Linux AppImage / `.deb`, and Electron desktop.
- 🎵 **More than chat** — DMs, group calls (WebRTC), reels, friend wall, music rooms (YT/Spotify/SoundCloud), Frog Channel imageboard, GIF picker, custom emojis.
- ⚒️ **Full API** — REST + WebSocket for bots, bridges and custom clients. Discord and Telegram bridges ship in-tree.

## Self-Host

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadinternetfox/frogtalk.git
cd frogtalk
cp deploy/env.example .env       # set ADMIN_PASSWORD, PORT, ALLOWED_ORIGINS
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py                   # → http://localhost:8080
```

Default admin login: `admin` / the value of `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env`.

### Guided setup + update scripts

```bash
# interactive self-host wizard (safe defaults + edge-case handling)
bash scripts/node_setup_wizard.sh

# check for upstream updates
bash scripts/node_update_check.sh

# apply updates safely (fast-forward only)
bash scripts/node_update_check.sh --apply
```

### Server Web Admin (node management)

Enable the secure node management dashboard:

```bash
export FROGTALK_SERVER_WEBUI_ENABLED=1
export FROGTALK_SERVER_WEBUI_USER=serveradmin
export FROGTALK_SERVER_WEBUI_PASSWORD='set-a-strong-password'
```

Then open:

- URL: `https://your-host/server`
- Login: `FROGTALK_SERVER_WEBUI_USER` / `FROGTALK_SERVER_WEBUI_PASSWORD`

Capabilities include live hardware telemetry (CPU/memory/disk/uptime), federation node inventory, node probe, and block/unblock controls.

Node Control also includes a per-node easter-egg editor: upload images/audio/video, format rich text, and set the hidden popup that appears after seven taps on the frog trigger for that node.

### Tor / Onion Hidden Service

To run your node as a Tor hidden service (`.onion` only, no clearnet exposure):

```bash
export FROGTALK_TOR_ENABLED=1
export FROGTALK_ONION_URL=http://youronionaddress.onion
# Leave FROGTALK_BASE_URL unset or empty to be onion-only
```

Use the onion app surface for user links and server switching:

```text
http://youronionaddress.onion/app
```

Clients using *Prefer onion endpoints* in Network Settings will automatically route all federation traffic through Tor. The clearnet IP is never shared with the directory or other nodes when `FROGTALK_TOR_ENABLED=1` and no `FROGTALK_BASE_URL` is set.

Onion-capable nodes display a `🧅 ONION` badge in the server list, and the node card shows the `.onion` address with a one-click copy button instead of a clearnet URL.

### Production (systemd)

```bash
sudo cp deploy/frogtalk.service /etc/systemd/system/frogtalk.service
# edit WorkingDirectory and User in the service file as needed
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now frogtalk
sudo systemctl status frogtalk
```

Logs: `journalctl -u frogtalk -f`

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t frogtalk .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  --name frogtalk frogtalk
```

### Nginx + HTTPS

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name chat.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## API & Bots

FrogTalk has a full REST + WebSocket API. Build bots, integrations, and custom clients.

```
GET  /api/rooms          # list public rooms
POST /api/messages       # send a message (with bridge_token)
WS   /ws/{room}          # real-time message stream
```

## Encryption Model

FrogTalk's crypto is layered by context so each surface gets the strongest
practical guarantee:

- **Direct messages — Signal Protocol.** X3DH key agreement against the
  recipient's published prekey bundle establishes a Double Ratchet session.
  Every DM advances the ratchet, so forward secrecy is per-message and a
  device compromise tomorrow can't decrypt today's traffic.
- **Room messages — per-channel AES-256-GCM with AAD binding + key rotation.**
  Private channels are sealed with a 256-bit AES-GCM key derived (HKDF-SHA-256)
  from a shared channel secret distributed to new members through their
  already-established Signal DM session. Ciphertext is bound to a specific
  room id and key version via AES-GCM Additional Authenticated Data
  (`room:<id>:v<N>`, v2 wire format `[0x02][iv:12][ct+tag]`), so a captured
  ciphertext cannot be replayed against another room or an older key. When a
  member is banned or kicked, or a moderator presses **Rotate room key now**,
  a fresh key is generated client-side and fanned out to every remaining
  member via their Signal DM session; the rotation is announced in-channel
  as a system message. Public channels intentionally have no key — they are
  designed to be world-readable and are stored encrypted-at-rest only.
- **Voice/video calls — DTLS fingerprint signing.** SDP offers and answers
  carry an XEdDSA signature over the call's DTLS fingerprint so a hostile
  signalling server can't silently MITM the media path. A Safety-Numbers
  panel surfaces the verified peer identity.
- **Wall posts — per-post AEAD wrapped to followers.** Each post is sealed
  with a fresh AES-256-GCM key; that key is then wrapped to each follower
  via their Signal DM session, so only the intended audience can read it.
- **Bridged channels.** Channels with an outbound Discord/Telegram bridge
  intentionally fall back to plaintext so the bridge can forward the
  message text to the third-party platform; this is clearly indicated in
  the channel header. **Bridges are not available for private (E2EE) rooms**
  — forwarding to Discord/Telegram would leak plaintext to a third-party
  service and defeat end-to-end encryption, so all four bridge-create
  endpoints reject private rooms with HTTP 403. DMs are never bridged.
- **Private keys** are generated client-side and never leave the device.
  They live in IndexedDB (web/desktop) or the OS keystore (Android/iOS).

In-app the **🔒 Encryption info** modal exposes the current safety number
for a DM, or the channel's encryption mode for a room.

## 🐸 Vibe-coded, but open source

FrogTalk is a **censorship-free platform where messages can stay private** — and it's
being built in the open with a process we're openly experimenting with: an AI-in-the-loop
workflow for small, honest software teams.

### Our development process

```
   ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐    ┌────────┐
   │  Idea   │ ─▶ │  AI slop    │ ─▶ │  Deslop (human pass) │ ─▶ │  Ship  │
   └─────────┘    └─────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘    └────────┘
```

- **Idea.** Issue, sketch, "what if we…" — barrier is low on purpose.
- **AI slop.** The first draft of most code is AI-generated. PRs are labelled `vibe-coded` so reviewers know what they're walking into.
- **Deslop.** A human reviewer fixes the security holes, kills dead code, tightens
  the names, rewrites lying comments, and actually exercises the change. Code is
  not considered done until it has been deslopped.
- **Ship.** Trunk-based: merge to `main`, deploy, watch the logs.

The encryption primitives are well-studied (X3DH + Double Ratchet for DMs,
per-room AES-256-GCM for private channels, DTLS-fingerprint signing for calls). The surrounding plumbing — DOM rendering, session handling,
media URLs, federation glue — is the kind of code that benefits from a second set
of eyes. **We'd rather hear from you than pretend it's flawless.**

### We need your help

This project is run by a tiny team. Every kind of contribution matters:

- 🐛 **Found a bug or security issue?** Report it at **<https://frogtalk.xyz/security>**
  — anonymous submissions accepted. For sensitive disclosures: `security@frogtalk.xyz`.
- 🔎 **Spotted AI slop in the codebase?** Open a [slop sighting](https://github.com/deadinternetfox/frogtalk/issues/new?template=slop_sighting.md)
  — file path, what looks wrong, why.
- 🧹 **Want to deslop?** Pick an issue tagged `deslop-needed` and send a PR. After a
  few solid reviews you can get write access. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- 🛠️ **New feature idea?** Half-formed is fine — file it as a [feature idea](https://github.com/deadinternetfox/frogtalk/issues/new?template=feature_idea.md).
- 📣 **Run a node.** More nodes = more censorship-resistance. Self-host guide above.
- 💬 **Tell people the project exists.** Community projects need a community.

Researchers who responsibly disclose are credited in the security advisory and on the
[Hall of Fame](https://frogtalk.xyz/security#hall-of-fame).

### Contributing

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full deslop process: the review
checklist (Correctness / Security / Operational / Honesty), label conventions
(`vibe-coded`, `deslopped`, `deslop-needed`, `slop-sighting`), and how to become a
deslopper. Quick start:

1. Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
2. If your PR is AI-drafted, label it `vibe-coded` — we'll deslop it together.
3. Run `node --check static/js/<file>.js` for any JS you touched — silent parse
   errors break every onclick on the page.
4. Run `python -m py_compile <file>.py` for any Python you touched.
5. Open a PR with the template filled in. For security fixes, include a PoC.
6. Add yourself to `CONTRIBUTORS.md` in the same PR.

See [`/security`](https://frogtalk.xyz/security) for scope, threat model, and
what counts as a vulnerability.
